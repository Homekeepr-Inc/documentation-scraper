# connection-auth on persistent is critical:
# persistent: Explicitly tells Squid to try and keep the connection open. (This is the default in modern Squid versions, but being explicit is good practice).
#connection-auth=on: Instructs Squid to send the Proxy-Authorization header on every request over that single persistent connection. 
# This is critical for proxies that require authentication on every transaction, even over a keep-alive connection.
